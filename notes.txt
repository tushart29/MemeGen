Below is an example of how to map in JavaScript 
function App() {
    const thingsArray = ["Thing 1", "Thing 2"]
    
    /**
     * Challenge: Map over the thingsArray to generate
     * a <p> element for each item and render them on the page
     * below the button
     */
    
    const thingsElements = thingsArray.map(thing => <p key={thing}>{thing}</p>)
    
    return (
        <div>
            <button>Add Item</button>
            {thingsElements}
        </div>
    )
}

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));


- to update the data on the page or the UI, need to access react state. state allows us to hook into the component, so whenever we update
the state, react will change the data on the UI

- props are passed when you call the component such as <Main name=Tushar />. In main componen,t you can access by prop.name. prop should
be an argument in the function like "e"xport default function Contact(props)"

- props refer to the properties begin passed into a component in order for it to work propertly. A comonent receving props
are not allowed to change those props data

- state is any vaules that is managed by the component. any time you have changing values that should be saved or displayed
you will likely use a state

- React.useState("Hello") returns an array
